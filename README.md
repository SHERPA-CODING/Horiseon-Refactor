# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon main website. The purpose of this refactoring  is to make the previous code more efficient, comprehensive and also accessible to all the persons visiting the page. The modification does not change the displayed styling of the page it just improves the search engine optimization.
 

 ## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Mock-Up
